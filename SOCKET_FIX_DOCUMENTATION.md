# Socket.IO Connection Fix - Documentation

## Problem Solved
- Fixed the connection/disconnection loop issue
- Resolved the "Cannot access 'serverIdString' before initialization" error
- Eliminated duplicate socket connections and memory leaks
- Implemented a stable, singleton-based socket connection

## What Changed

### 1. **Created SocketContext Provider** (`src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`)
- Implements a singleton pattern for the socket connection
- Uses a global socket instance to prevent multiple connections
- Manages all socket state in a centralized location
- Provides a clean API through React Context

### 2. **Updated useStableSocket Hook** (`src/hooks/useStableSocket.ts`)
- Now uses the SocketContext instead of managing its own socket
- Maintains the same API for backwards compatibility
- Simplified logic by delegating to the context

### 3. **Modified useSocket Hook** (`src/hooks/useSocket.ts`)
- Now acts as a simple wrapper around SocketContext
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing code

### 4. **Added SocketProvider to App Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Wraps the entire application with the SocketProvider
- Ensures a single socket instance throughout the app

### 5. **Fixed serverIdString Initialization** (`src/app/_components/serverPage.tsx`)
- Moved `serverIdString` declaration before its usage
- Prevents the "before initialization" error

## How It Works

1. **Single Socket Instance**: The SocketContext creates and maintains a single global socket instance that persists across component re-renders.

2. **Smart Reconnection**: The socket only reconnects when necessary (e.g., after a network error), not on every component update.

3. **Minimal Dependencies**: The socket initialization effect has minimal dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-initialization.

4. **Event Handler Management**: All event handlers are attached once and properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks.

5. **State Management**: Socket state (connection status, voice channels, server members) is managed centrally and distributed via context.

## Benefits

- **No More Loops**: The connection/disconnection loop is eliminated
- **Better Performance**: Single socket instance reduces overhead
- **Cleaner Code**: Centralized socket management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Usage

The socket is automatically initialized when a user logs in. Components can access socket functionality through the `useStableSocket` or `useSocket` hooks:

```typescript
const { 
  isConnected, 
  sendMessage, 
  joinChannel,
  // ... other methods
} = useStableSocket({ serverId, channelId, onMessage });
```

## Running the Fixed Version

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x restart-fixed-socket.sh
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   ./restart-fixed-socket.sh
   ```

The server will start with the fixed socket implementation, and you should no longer see connection loops or initialization errors.
