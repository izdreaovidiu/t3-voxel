# Discord Server Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Runtime Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'username')"
**File:** `/src/app/_components/serverPage.tsx` (line ~339)

**Problem:** The code was trying to access `newMessage.user.username` where `newMessage.user` was undefined.

**Fix:** 
- Added safe navigation with fallback: `newMessage.username || newMessage.user?.username || "Unknown User"`
- Added null check before subscribing to messages: `if (!selectedChannel) return;`

### 2. Console Error: "Maximum update depth exceeded"
**File:** `/src/app/_components/serverPage.tsx` (line ~361)

**Problem:** The useEffect for channel data was causing infinite re-renders due to unnecessary state updates.

**Fix:**
- Added proper comparison to only update state when data actually changes
- Used JSON.stringify comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added condition to only update when channelData has content

### 3. Console Error: "Message send timeout"
**File:** `/src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx` (line ~233)

**Problem:** Socket message sending was timing out due to poor error handling and short timeout.

**Fix:**
- Increased timeout from 5000ms to 10000ms
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Implemented `hasResolved` flag to prevent double resolution
- Added more user data to message payload (userId, username, avatar)
- Improved callback handling for socket emit

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Message Sending State Management
- Added `sendingMessage` state to prevent double-sending
- Added loading spinner on send button during message sending
- Improved error handling with message restoration on failure

### 2. Socket Connection Robustness
- Added user ID checking to prevent unnecessary reconnections
- Improved connection handling for user switches
- Better error logging and debugging information

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear input immediately for better perceived performance
- Restore message content on send failure
- Visual feedback during message sending
- Better error logging for debugging

## Testing the Fixes

To test that the fixes work:

1. **Send a message** - Should no longer show timeout errors
2. **Switch channels rapidly** - Should not cause infinite loops
3. **Check browser console** - Should see cleaner logs without the previous errors
4. **Refresh after sending** - Message should appear correctly without client-side errors

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/_components/serverPage.tsx`
   - Fixed message subscription error handling
   - Fixed infinite loop in channel data useEffect
   - Added message sending state management
   - Improved error handling and UX

2. `/src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`
   - Fixed message send timeout issues
   - Improved socket connection robustness
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Enhanced message payload with user data

## Next Steps

If you still experience issues:

1. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify your socket.io server is handling the `message:send` event properly
3. Ensure your backend is returning proper response format: `{ success: boolean, message?: any, error?: string }`
4. Test with network throttling to ensure timeout handling works correctly

All the major client-side errors should now be resolved, and the message sending should work smoothly without the refresh requirement.
