# ✅ WebSocket Fixes & Voice/Video Re-implementation Complete

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Socket Connection Loop Issue ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Socket was reconnecting constantly, causing loop and messages not appearing
**Root Cause**: Unstable dependencies in useSocket hook causing infinite re-renders
**Solution**: 
- Fixed useEffect dependencies in `useSocket.ts`
- Removed function dependencies that caused loops
- Added reconnection timeout management
- Improved cleanup and error handling

### 2. Missing Voice/Video Features ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Voice, video, and screen sharing functionality was removed
**Solution**: Re-implemented full featured WebSocket system with:
- ✅ Voice channels
- ✅ Video calls  
- ✅ Screen sharing
- ✅ WebRTC signaling
- ✅ Presence system (online/offline/away status)
- ✅ Server members tracking
